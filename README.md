# Blockchain Project
This project was an assignment from 2nd year semester 2 Immersive Software Engineering.

The challenge was to implement a fully-featured Web3-based ticketing system built on the ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

I chose to use Svelte for the frontend as I had never used it before and wanted to learn it.

I have serious doubts about how practical a web3 backend would be for a real application but this was a fun project and I learned a huge amount about blockchains.

# Default Svelte Project README:
## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
